# ecampus-scraper

A simple script to scrape your grades from the THM eCampus Platform. This script is very robust and easy to use unlike some Rust soulutions out there. Simply
create a constants.py and define the ``JSESSIONID`` cookie along with the URL of your individual Exams Extract. The script takes the module id as argument and prints the grade to the console as soon as the desired grade is published. <br>
